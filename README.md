# Sudoku Solver Algorithm

This Python implementation solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking method. In this method, we iteratively assign values to the cells of a Sudoku grid until we find a solution or determine that the current path cannot lead to a complete solution. If an assignment leads to a conflict, we backtrack to the previous step and try a different value.

How it Works

1. Initialize a 2D Sudoku grid of size 9x9.
2. Define a utility function my_sudoku_solver(board) to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
3. The is_valid_move(row, col, num) function checks if assigning num to a cell is valid based on Sudoku rules. It verifies that num is not already present in the same row, column, or     3x3 subgrid.
4. We use a recursive approach to solve the Sudoku puzzle. We start from the top-left cell and iterate through each cell. If a cell is empty (contains 0), we try assigning numbers 5.     from 1 to 9 (inclusive) and check if the assignment is valid.
5. If a valid number is found, we recursively proceed to the next cell. If we reach the end of the grid without conflicts, a solution is found.
6. If a conflict arises or we cannot find a valid assignment, we backtrack to the previous cell and try a different number.
7. The process continues until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
